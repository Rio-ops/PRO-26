# RECIPE

### MAKING SUGAR SYRUP

1. Add 1/5 cups sugar and lightly crushed 4 green cardamoms to a pot. You can also use organic or turbinado sugar, the color of the syrup will be darker.

2. Pour 1.5 cups water.

3. Boil this until the syrup turns slightly sticky. To check this, cool little syrup in a small plate. Dip your fore finger in it and touch with your thumb. You feel it is slighlty sticky. It should not reach one string consistency. If you fail to make the syrup correctly, then the **JAMUN** will not soak the syrup and turn soft. If you go past the syrup stage, you will end up in a ine string consistency. In that case, add little water and stir. Check again. Switch off. Add rose water.

### MAKING DOUGH

4. Measure 1 cup milk powder, 1/4 cup +1 tbsps all purpose flour or maida and then a large pinch of soda. If you use more soda than the balls may break.

5. Then mix them very well or sieve it. Make sure the mixture is uniform. Add 1tsp of ghee.

6. Next mix well everything.

7. Take 1tbsp of yugurt or 3/4 tbsp lemon juice and 2tbsp of milk. Mix both together.

8. Pour 1.5 of this of the flour. Begin to mix. Use up the rest as needed. Do not knead the dough. If the dough is too dry use little more milk.

9. The dough turns slightly sticky and refuses to leave the fingers. Grease your finger and make a stiff yet soft dough. This should be the right consistency of the dough. If by chance it turns sticky sprinkle another tsp of plain flour. This is just to fix and does alter the texture.

10. Divide the dough to 14 and 18 equal portions and make smooth balls without any lines  or crack them. Do not knead or press the balls. Be gentle in handling the dough.

### HOW TO MAKE GULAB JAMUN

11. Pour ghee or oil to a hot pan. I prefer ghee to oil since ghee has a better smoke point than oil.

12. Ghee or oil must be just medium hot and and not very hot. Else rhe gulab jamun will brown without cooking inside. To check the correct temperture, add a small piece of small dough to the oil. The ball must rise slowly without changing it's color much. This is the right temperature. If the ball rises fast, then the temperature is a bit high. Then take off from the stove for a while.

13. Add the balls gently and fry them on a medium heat for 1 and 2 mins. While frying the balls will get increase in size, so provide them enough space in the pan.

14. After 2 mins of frying, reduce the flame to low and fry until golden. Keep stirring gently to fry them evenly. 

15. When they turn golden, take them off the pan using a deep fry skimmer or a strainer. Drain them very well.

16. Add them directly to the hot sugar syrup. Do not dunk them with oil dripping. The sugar syrup must be hot, not very hot or steaming hot.
